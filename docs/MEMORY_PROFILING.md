There are different ways to do heap profiling but it looks like jemalloc heap profiling works currently best for Pyston. (unfortunately valgrind often crashes currently if the ICs are enabled)

## Prerequisites
Pyston comes with jemalloc which is already configured with enabled profiling.
But because we currently don't install the header one needs to run as a workaround `sudo apt-get install libjemalloc-dev` to install the system package and rebuild jemalloc afterwards.

## Usage
The jemalloc documentation about profiling can be found [here](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki/Use-Case%3A-Heap-Profiling) and the one about leak checking [here](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc/wiki/Use-Case%3A-Leak-Checking).

an example usage is:
```
~/pyston$ MALLOC_CONF="prof:true,prof_prefix:jeprof.out" ./pyston_release minibenchmarks/raytrace.py
~/pyston$ ./build/Release/jemalloc/bin/jeprof pyston_release jeprof.out.*
